Lolish is a free GNU/Linux shell under the wtfpl(check http://www.wtfpl.net/).
The shell has no dependencies, excluding glibc, lots of things are hard coded and some do not work as intended, 
but I do not have the time to fix it(rewrite it).
If you would like to rad more about the project, read the man files in the doc/ directory, it should be easy to understand.
If you would like to get involved with ]this[, just send me an email to one of the following: <kurotsuki_l@yahoo.com>, 
<krpeychev@gmail.com>, I am ready to outsource this whole project.
Instalation instructions:

0. Get in to the source directory.

1. Type `make` or `make install` to compile the source, the latter installs it to /usr/bin, so you will probably 
need to be root.

2. To run the interactive shell type `./lolish` or `lolish` respectively.
